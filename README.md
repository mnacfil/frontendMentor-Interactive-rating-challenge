## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

Overall this challenge is interesting I learned many things like, How to setup the functionalition, positioning, layouting this in a good view.

This enhance my skills ing HTML and css on proper layouting and applying some proper margin and padding to look like a original one.

this also enhance my vanilla javacript skills on how I can change the color of button rating while removing all the style of other. overall this is good practice and like it.

### Continued development

probably some animations like when I click submit button the result will eventually pop-out in the screen just like that.

### Useful resources
